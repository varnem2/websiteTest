Armadillo Eggs Recipe
Ingredients:
12 jalapeno peppers
2 cup Biscuit mix (dry)
12 oz. shredded cheese
2 lb. hot pork sausage
2 pkg Shake-n-Bake pork seasoning in a ziploc.
Instructions:
Tear the sausage into little bits.
In a bowl, mix sausage, biscuit mix, and 6 oz. of cheese into a dough.
(add a little water if it's too dry)

Cut the stem and tip off a pepper.
Cut the pepper in half to make two round pieces and remove the seeds.
Stuff the pepper with cheese.
Create a very flat patty of the biscuit/sausage mixture.
Place a stuffed pepper piece on the patty and wrap the dough around the pepper, pinching the dough sealed, forming an egg shape.
Drop the pepper in the ziploc and shake it to coat well.
Repeat with all pepper pieces.

Heat the dutch oven to 350 degrees for Baking.
Place a layer of wrapped peppers in the dutch oven and Bake 30 minutes, until they are very brown all over. Be sure to cook the sausage well.
