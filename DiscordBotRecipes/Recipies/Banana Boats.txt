Banana Boats Recipe

 
Required:
aluminum foil
knife
Ingredients:
1 banana per person
mini-marshamallows
chocolat chips
butterscotch chips
M&Ms
Reese's Pieces
brown sugar
other optional bits
Notes:
If you can peel back the peel and leave it attached at one end, it works better.
Eat the sliced out banana piece as a taste of things to come.
Instructions:
The 1/4 of the peel that is on the inside of the curve needs to be peeled out of the way. Leave the rest on to hold the banana together. Try to leave the top peel attached. 
Cut out a groove of banana to make your boat. 
Fill the boat with whatever cargo you want - chips, marshmallows, brown sugar, ... 
Lay the peel back on top. 
Wrap it tightly in tin foil.
