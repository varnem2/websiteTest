Bannock Recipe

Ingredients:
4 cups flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons oil
1 1/2 cup water
Optional: brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, honey, ...
Instructions:
Mix ingredients and add water until you have a doughy consistency - don't just dump all the water in.
Knead approximately 10 minutes.
Add sugar, honey, or raisins if you want it sweeter.
Grease and heat a frying pan. Form and press the dough into cakes.
Lay the bannock in the frying pan.
As the bannock cooks, move the cakes around so they don't stick.
When the bottom crust has formed and is browned, flip the cakes over.
Cooking takes about 12 minutes.
Sprinkle with honey or brown sugar and eat.
