Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Protein Balls
Ingredients

1 cup oats
2 tbsp flax (ground or whole is fine if able to pulverize into a powder)
1 cup raw almonds
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp maca
1/2-whole scoop natural unsweetened protein powder (if using vanilla, use only 3 tbsp of honey to start, then add the 4th tbsp once you've tasted it)
1 tbsp vanilla
3-4 tbsp honey
2 tbsp coconut oil in liquid state
3-4 tbsp chocolate chips (if you want homemade, use my chocolate cups recipe and put in a long tupperware container with parchment paper, freeze and break into pieces)
Instructions

DIRECTIONS
1. Blend or puree the dry ingredients (all but the last 3 ingredients) together until they are powdery like a flour. If you do not have a high-speed blender or food processor, use almond flour and ground flax.
2. In a bowl, stir together the blended ingredients and the last 3 ingredients until everything is moistened evenly.
3. Form into 10 protein balls and refrigerate overnight for the best flavor.
4. Enjoy!
