3 dates
2 frozen, sliced bananas
1/4-1/3 cup milk (I used coconut milk)
1 tsp vanilla powder
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp amond extract
pinch of salt
pinch of nutmeg
Swirl in:
1 tbsp unsweetened peanut butter (take very small chunks at a time
Raw Chocolate Chunks or cacao nibs
walnut pieces (optional)
Top with:
Banana Macadamia Nut Granola
fresh bananas
Instructions

Blend all of the ingredients from the "blend" section in a food processor or high-speed blender. Blend about 30 seconds-1 minute, or on the "Frozen Desserts" mode on your blender.
Use the plunger to evenly smooth out the ingredients or stop every 10 seconds to scrape the sides.
Once blended (dates should be pureed completely), place in a bowl.
Take the tbsp of unsweetened peanut butter and evenly distribute throughout the ice cream by placing the peanut butter in 1/4 tbsp chunks. Then, swirl!
Swirl in the rest of the ingredients
Place in a bowl and top with toppings for an extra special treat or breakfast!
