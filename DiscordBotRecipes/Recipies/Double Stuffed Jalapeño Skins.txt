Double Stuffed Jalapeño Skins

Ingredients

1 whole Potato
1 Tablespoon Avocado Oil
4 whole Jalapeños
½ teaspoons Sweet Paprika
½ teaspoons Garlic Powder
½ teaspoons Cumin
½ teaspoons Onion Powder
½ teaspoons Oregano
2 Tablespoons Cooked And Pureed Cauliflower
½ cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese (see Website For Vegan Option or use vegan cheese)
2 Tablespoons Plain Yogurt (dairy Or Dairy-free)
½ teaspoons Minced Parsley
½ teaspoons Garlic Powder
1 teaspoon Avocado Oil
Instructions

Preheat oven to 400°F. Coat the outside of the potato with the avocado oil and bake at 400°F for 1:20 minutes.
While the potato is baking, roast the jalapeños by holding them over the flame on your stove over medium-high heat until lightly browned on all sides. Then remove from heat and slice the jalapeños in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds (reserve them if you want to add some heat later) and membranes and set peppers aside.
After the potato is done baking, scoop out the potato flesh and mix it with the remaining ingredients (except for the peppers, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp of avocado oil) in a bowl.
Stuff the jalapeños, put them on a tray and put it in the oven.
Bake at 400°F for another 10 minutes. If you prefer to have less heat, cook them for 15 minutes. For more heat, bake the seeds in the oven for 10 minutes next to the stuffed jalapeños with 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp avocado oil. Sprinkle on top as an extra spicy and crunchy topping!
