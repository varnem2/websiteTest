Why You Should Care About the Differences Between Granola and Muesli – Plus a Muesli Recipe!

Ingredients

6 cups of organic rolled oats (buy them gluten-free if you are gluten-free)
1/2 cup pecan pieces
1/2 walnut pieces
1/2 coconut flakes
1/2 sunflower seeds
2 TB sesame seeds
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 cup coconut sugar (you can add a little honey or maple syrup if you like)
1 TB vanilla
3 TB flax seeds
1 cup dried cherries or raisins (do not put in oven)
Instructions

Set oven at 350 degrees F.
Pour 6 cups oats into large roasting pan. Spread into thin layer. Add nuts, coconut flakes, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, yeast, vanilla and sugar. Toss to spread evenly.
Pulverize flax seeds, but these will be roasted separately because they need to be refrigerated for optimal storage, since the muesli lasts longer than room temperature life of ground flax. If you want to toast flax with the muesli, the muesli must be refrigerated.
Toast muesli about 35 minutes or until light golden brown. Stir halfway through. Remove
muesli from oven to cool and toast flax sees for about 15 minutes in the hot oven.
Add dried fruit to muesli and store in airtight container. Refrigerate ground flax seed in and add tsp when serving. Return unused flax seeds to fridge.
