6 pita breads
1 14oz. can pizza sauce
12 oz. grated cheese
1 7oz. pkg sliced pepperoni

Notes:
Use precooked meat since you are just heating it up.
Instructions:
Cut each pita bread in half to form two pockets and spoon pizza sauce into pocket spreading it evenly. 
Add 4 or 5 slices of pepperoni, 1 ounce of cheese, and other toppings. Don't overstuff it or it will tear.
Repeat to make a dozen pockets.
Stand the pockets up in the dutch oven.
