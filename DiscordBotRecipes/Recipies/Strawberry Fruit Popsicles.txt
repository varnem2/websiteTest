Skin-Saving Strawberry Fruit Popsicles

Ingredients

10 oz bag strawberries, fresh or thawed for the smoothest blend
1 banana
1 avocado
1/2 cup maple syrup (or until desired sweetness)
up to 1/4 cup orange juice (use as little as possible, just enough for everything to blend smoothly)
about 1 tbsp lemon juice (for tartness)
1 banana, sliced
Instructions

Pre-freeze popsicle molds so the bananas stick to the sides better
Blend all the ingredients (except for the sliced banana) into the blender and blend until smooth.
Take out the popsicle mold from freezer and stick your sliced bananas to the sides of your mold, about 6 banana slices per mold
Pour the blender ingredients into the popsicle molds, put the sticks in, and freeze overnight
