Taco in a Bag Recipe

 
Ingredients:
1 individual Dorito chips bag
1/3 cup hamburger
1/3 cup refried beans
2 Tbsp shredded cheese
salsa
Notes:
This is quite a popular meal with the scouts I have around, but it's hard to call it cooking. :-)
Instructions:
Cook the hamburger in a skillet.
Heat the beans.
Cut open the end of a bag of chips.
Spoon in some hamburger and beans, sprinkle on cheese, pour in salsa.
