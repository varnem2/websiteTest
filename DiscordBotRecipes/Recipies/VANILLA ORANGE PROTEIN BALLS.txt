VANILLA ORANGE PROTEIN BALLS

½ cup + 2 tbsp vanilla protein powder (I used Arbonne)
½ cup coconut flour
1 tbsp cinnamon
1 cup chopped Medjool dates
1 heaping tbsp orange zest
1 tbsp honey
½ cup honey vanilla tea (chamomille tea or water would work)
¾ – 1 cup fresh orange juice

1. Sift protein powder, coconut flour and cinnamon into a large bowl. Set aside.
2. Add ¾-ish cup of water to a mug, warm 1-2 minutes until hot and steep honey vanilla tea bag. Set aside.
3. Combine chopped dates, orange zest, ¾ cup orange juice, and ½ cup of tea in food processor. Process for 1-2 minutes, until dates are pureed and mixture is smooth.
4. Add 1 cup of dry ingredients (there should be some left over) to bowl, along with wet ingredients from food processor. Use spoon to combine until all dry ingredients are gone.
5. If mixture is looking dry, sprinkle more of the dry ingredients. If mixture is too dry, add more orange juice. You want the mixture to stick together enough to form balls.
7. Form mixture into balls with hands, or an ice cream scoop or melon baller, if handy.
8. Store balls in freezer.
